# Superseded: public source-history archive

The active rewindDV project is [rewinddv/rewindDV](https://github.com/rewinddv/rewindDV).
Use that repository for application and driver source, engineering releases,
installation and compatibility documentation, issues and contributions.

This repository (ID 1402605229) preserves the pre-consolidation public source
history. Its reviewed default-branch history was merged into the surviving
project (ID 1382559648, formerly rewindDV-LAB) without rewriting either history.
The source below is retained as a historical snapshot; this repository is no
longer an active development or support destination. Existing licenses and
attribution remain applicable. No binary was rebuilt or republished by this move.

This is the canonical open-source repository for rewindDV. Visit the
[project website](https://rewinddv.com) or the
[testing and release hub](https://github.com/rewinddv/rewindDV-LAB).
An interim [Alpha 0.0.81 / Driver Build183 engineering alpha](https://github.com/rewinddv/rewindDV-LAB/releases/tag/alpha-0.0.81) is available separately. It is ad-hoc signed, not notarized, and requires disabling SIP, which reduces macOS security. See [installation scope](INSTALLATION-PLAN.md).

rewindDV is a macOS FireWire DV/HDV preservation project. This package contains
the tested Alpha 0.0.81 application source and unchanged Build183 driver inputs.
It is a source package, not an official installable binary release.

Alpha 0.0.81 adds bounded-memory DV/HDV post-capture processing, raw DV25
NTSC/PAL playback transitions, source-frame inspector values and a fixed playback
viewport. These improvements are offline validated; they do not extend physical
PAL/HDV qualification. See [current release notes](Foundation/Docs/Alpha081ReleaseNotes.md).

The application reserves capture-start ownership before waiting for an existing
device query. A cancelled waiting request cannot later start capture. Rejection
before receiving does not clean up another session, reuse its final counters,
claim saved media or create a new STOP warning. Existing STOP obligations remain
visible until supported evidence resolves them.

Bounded tests on one Sony HVR-M15U NTSC DV setup passed first-attempt manual
starts, whole-tape cancellation/final accounting, a subsequent capture and an
idle reconnect. This does not establish every timing interaction, device or
format. Read [COMPATIBILITY](COMPATIBILITY.md) and
[KNOWN-LIMITATIONS](KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) before drawing broader conclusions.

Capture preserves received bytes and records integrity, continuity and source
quality observations. Matching saved-byte hashes do not prove pristine pictures
or sound, lossless transport or successful recovery. Unknown and conflicting
observations remain distinct from confirmed facts.
